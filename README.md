# Build Regex

Class that allows you to build a regex string from understandably named methods. Allows for advanced regex operations and opens regex up for everyone without knowing the advanced parts of it. It will be treated similar to a query system or key word class builder syntax. Inspiration for this project is [magic-regexp](https://regexp.dev/getting-started/setup).
